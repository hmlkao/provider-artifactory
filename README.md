# Provider Artifactory

`provider-artifactory` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
Artifactory API.

## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/hmlkao/provider-artifactory):

```bash
up ctp provider install hmlkao/provider-artifactory:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-artifactory
spec:
  package: hmlkao/provider-artifactory:v0.1.0
EOF
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/hmlkao/provider-artifactory).
